# RSNA-Dataset-Pre-processed
We pre-Porcessed (cropped) RSNA Bone Dataset manually, so this performs better compared to other automatic methods.
Here, we publish the validation dataset, partially. We plan to publish the entire training and validation set in the future.
However, no rotation is applied to align the images (for the published validation set). To conduct an experiment, it's better to rotate images to align.
Please cite this if use the (partially) publish dataset.
